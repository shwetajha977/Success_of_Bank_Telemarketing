# Success of Bank Telemarketing (Machine Learning Project)

## Overview
This project explores the success of bank telemarketing campaigns using machine learning techniques. It employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict customer responses based on a dataset of telemarketing activities. The goal is to analyze patterns in customer behavior and provide insights to optimize telemarketing efforts.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for effective analysis.
- Implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using Python.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- Insights derived from feature importance and model predictions.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (if applicable for the MLP implementation)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
   ```
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Success\ of\ Bank\ Telemarketing-MLP.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the cells step-by-step to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Build and train the MLP model.
   - Evaluate model performance and analyze results.

## Output
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualizations of data distributions, training performance, and model predictions.
- Insights into the most influential features in predicting telemarketing success.
